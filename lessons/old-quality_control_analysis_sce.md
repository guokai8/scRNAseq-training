# Single-cell RNA-seq: Quality control

</p>

Each step of this workflow has its own goals and challenges. For QC of our raw count data, they include:

_**Goals:**_ 
 
 - _To **filter the data to only include true cells that are of high quality**, so that when we cluster our cells it is easier to identify distinct cell type populations_
 - _To **identify any failed samples** and either try to salvage the data or remove from analysis, in addition to, trying to understand why the sample failed_

_**Challenges:**_
 
 - _Delineating cells that are **poor quality from less complex cells**_
 - _Choosing appropriate thresholds for filtering, so as to **keep high quality cells without removing biologically relevant cell types**_

_**Recommendations:**_
 
 - _Have a good idea of your expectations for the **cell types to be present** prior to performing the QC. For instance, do you expect to have low complexity cells or cells with higher levels of mitochondrial expression in your sample? If so, then we need to account for this biology when assessing the quality of our data._


## Biology of our dataset

The dataset we will be working with is from [Kang et al, 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4042) and is comprised of pooled Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) taken from eight lupus patients split into control and interferon beta-treated conditions. The libraries were prepared using 10X Genomics version 2 chemistry and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500. This dataset is freely available from 10X Genomics and is used as part of the [Seurat tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/v3.0/immune_alignment.html). 

Since the samples are PBMCs, we will expect immune cells, such as:

- B cells
- T cells
- NK cells
- monocytes
- macrophages
- possibly megakaryocytes

None of these cell types are low complexity or anticipated to have high mitochondrial content.

> **NOTE:** The matrix files for this dataset on GEO ([GSE96583](http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE96583)) lacked mitochondrial reads, so we downloaded the BAM files from the SRA ([SRP102802](https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/sra?term=SRP102802)), converted the BAM files back to FASTQ files, then re-ran Cell Ranger. 


## Setting up the R environment

Before we can start our analysis, we need to make sure we have an organized directory structure. Create a new R project entitled `single_cell_rnaseq`. Then, create the following directories:

```
single_cell_rnaseq/
├── data
├── results
└── figures

```

### Download data

**Right-click** the links below to download the output folders from Cell Ranger for each sample into the `data` folder:

- [Control sample](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/73drh0ipmzfcrb3/AADMlKXCr5QGoaQN13-GbeKSa?dl=1)
- [Stimulated sample](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cii4j356moc08w5/AAC2c3jfvh2hHWPmEaVsZKRva?dl=1) 

Finally, create an Rscript and type the following note:

```r
# Single-cell RNA-seq analysis - QC
```

Save the Rscript as `quality_control.R`. Your working directory should look something like this:

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/Rstudio_singlecell.png" width="500">
</p>

### Loading libraries 

Now, we can load the necessary libraries:

```r
# Load libraries
library(Matrix.utils)
library(SingleCellExperiment)
library(Seurat)
library(knitr)
library(rmarkdown)
library(tidyverse)
library(Matrix)
library(AnnotationHub)
library(ensembldb)
library(scales)
```

## Obtaining quality metrics for assessment

Throughout the analysis workflow post-QC, we will rely heavily on the Seurat package; however, **Seurat doesn't have all of the functions for exploring the QC in depth**. Therefore, we will perform our own quality assessment outside of Seurat.

### Creating count data object

Generally, all single-cell RNA-seq datasets, regardless of technology or pipeline, will contain **three files**:

1. a file with the **gene IDs**, representing all genes quantified
2. a file with the **cell IDs**, representing all cells quantified
3. a **matrix of counts** per gene for every cell


We can explore these files by clicking on the `data/ctrl_raw_feature_bc_matrix` folder:

- **`barcodes.tsv`:** cellular barcodes present in dataset

  <p align="center">
  <img src="../img/cell_ids_new.png" width="180">
  </p>
  
- **`genes.tsv`:** IDs of quantified genes

  <p align="center">
  <img src="../img/genes.png" width="300">
  </p>

- **`matrix.mtx`:** a matrix of count values, where rows are associated with the gene IDs above and columns correspond to the cellular barcodes. Note that there are many zero values in this matrix.

  <p align="center">
  <img src="../img/sparse_matrix.png">
  </p>

We can create a count matrix using these files. However, instead of creating a standard count matrix, we will create a **sparse matrix** to improve the amount of space, memory and CPU required to work with our huge count matrix. 

We will use `readMM()` function from the **Matrix** package to turn our standard matrix into a sparse matrix. The `genes.tsv` file should correspond to the genes or row names of the matrix, while `barcodes.tsv` corresponds to the cells or columns.

```r
# Read in `matrix.mtx`
counts <- readMM("data/filtered_gene_bc_matrices/hg19/matrix.mtx")

# Read in `genes.tsv`
genes <- read_tsv("data/filtered_gene_bc_matrices/hg19/genes.tsv", col_names = FALSE)
gene_ids <- genes$X1

# Read in `barcodes.tsv`
cell_ids <- read_tsv("data/filtered_gene_bc_matrices/hg19/barcodes.tsv", col_names = FALSE)$X1
```

Then we can add row names to the count matrix to be the gene IDs and the column names of the count matrix to be the cell IDs.

```r
# Make the column names as the cell IDs and the row names as the gene IDs
rownames(counts) <- gene_ids
colnames(counts) <- cell_ids
```

We could use this data for downstream QC analysis. However, this would take a long time if we had multiple samples. A quicker way to load multiple samples is to use the Seurat R package, which has a specific function for reading in 10X data, called `read10X()`. 

> **NOTE:** If using other droplet-based methods for library preparation, the above method would be needed to perform the QC. We have [additional materials]() available based on creation of the count matrix in this way.

#### Reading in 10X data

The `read10X()` function from the Seurat R package expects the Cell Ranger sample output folder to have a folder called `outs`. This directory will contain a number of output files including:

- **`web_summary.html`:** report that explores different QC metrics, including the mapping metrics, filtering thresholds, estimated number of cells after filtering, and information on the number of reads and genes per cell after filtering.
- **BAM alignment files:** files used for visualization of the mapped reads and for re-creation of FASTQ files, if needed
- **`filtered_feature_bc_matrix`:** folder containing all files needed to construct the count matrix using data filtered by Cell Ranger
- **`raw_feature_bc_matrix`:** folder containing all files needed to construct the count matrix using the raw unfiltered data

We are mainly interested in the `raw_feature_bc_matrix` as we wish to perform our own QC and filtering while accounting about the biology of our experiment.

To read in the 10X data, we will use the `read10X()` function with the path to the `raw_feature_bc_matrix` folder as the argument. Then, we would turn this count matrix into a Seurat object using the `CreateSeuratObject()` function. If we had a single sample, we could run these steps like:

```r
# How to read in 10X data for a single sample
ctrl_counts <- Read10X(data.dir = "data/ctrl_raw_feature_bc_matrix")

# Turn count matrix into a Seurat object
ctrl <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = ctrl_counts,
                           min.features = 100)
```

The `min.features` argument specifies the minimum number of genes that need to be detected per cell. This argument will filter out poor quality cells that likely just have random barcodes encapsulated without any cell present. We would not be interested in analyzing any cells with less than 100 genes detected.

Notice that Seurat automatically creates some metadata for each of the cells:

```r
# Explore the metadata
head(ctrl@meta.data)
```

The added columns include:

- `orig.ident`: this often contains the sample identity if known, but will default to "SeuratProject"
- `nCount_RNA`: number of UMIs per cell
- `nFeature_RNA`: number of genes detected per cell

The data that we would like to perform the QC on is stored inside the `counts` slot of the Seurat object, and in version 3 of Seurat, we can access it using the `GetAssayData()` function.

```r
# Extract counts
counts <- GetAssayData(object = ctrl, slot = "counts")
```

We also need the metadata saved as a separate object:

```r
# Extract metadata
metadata <- ctrl@meta.data
```

This data can be used for downstream QC analysis; however, we have more than one sample and we would like to explore the QC metrics for both samples side-by-side. For more than a single sample it can be helpful to read data into Seurat with a `for loop`.

#### Reading in 10X data with a `for loop`

A `for loop` interates over a series of commands for each of the inputs given. In R, it has the structure:

```r
for (variable in input){
	command1
	command2
	command3
}
```

The `input` generally has multiple files provided, so the commands 1-3 are run on each of the files, one after the other.

The `for loop` we plan to run creates Seurat objects for each of our samples as follows:

```r
# Create each individual Seurat object for every sample
for (file in c("ctrl_raw_feature_bc_matrix", "stim_raw_feature_bc_matrix")){
        seurat_data <- Read10X(data.dir = paste0("data/", file))
        seurat_obj <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = seurat_data, 
                                         min.features = 100, 
                                         project = file)
        sample <- file
        assign(sample, seurat_obj)
}
```

Now, let's break down the `for loop` between the different steps:

##### Step 1: Specify inputs

For our experiment, we have two samples that we would like to read into R using the `Read10X()` function:

- `ctrl_raw_feature_bc_matrix` 
- `stim_raw_feature_bc_matrix`

We can specify these samples in the *input* part for our `for loop`. The *variable* we can call anything we would like, just try to make it intuitive. In this example, we called the *variable* `file`:

```r
# Create each individual Seurat object
for (file in c("ctrl_raw_feature_bc_matrix", "stim_raw_feature_bc_matrix")){
```

##### Step 2: Create command to read in data for the input

We can continue our `for loop` by:

- Creating a variable with the name of our sample called `sample`. We will be using this variable for naming purposes downstream. 
- Using the path to the files for input to the `Read10X()` function. We need to specify the path to the file, so we will prepend the `data/` directory to our sample folder name using the `paste0()` function.

```r
# Create each individual Seurat object
for (file in c("ctrl_raw_feature_bc_matrix", "stim_raw_feature_bc_matrix")){
        seurat_data <- Read10X(data.dir = paste0("data/", file))
```

##### Step 3: Create Seurat object from the 10X data

Now, we can create the Seurat object by using the `CreateSeuratObject()` function, adding in the argument `project`, where we can add the sample name into the `orig.ident` slot of the metadata.

```r
for (file in c("ctrl_raw_feature_bc_matrix", "stim_raw_feature_bc_matrix")){
        seurat_data <- Read10X(data.dir = paste0("data/", file))
        seurat_obj <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = seurat_data, 
                                         min.features = 100, 
                                         project = file)        
```

##### Step 4: Assign Seurat object to a new variable based on sample

The last command assigns the Seurat object created (`seurat_obj`) to a variable called by the sample name (`sample`). We need to assign the Seurat object to a variable with a new name, otherwise we would overwrite our `seurat_obj` every iteration through the loop.

```r
for (file in c("ctrl_raw_feature_bc_matrix", "stim_raw_feature_bc_matrix")){
        seurat_data <- Read10X(data.dir = paste0("data/", file))
        seurat_obj <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = seurat_data, 
                                         min.features = 100, 
                                         project = file)        
        sample <- file
        assign(sample, seurat_obj)
}
```

Now that we have our Seurat objects for each sample, we need to merge them together to run QC on them at the same time. We can use the `merge()` function to do this:

```r
# Create a merged Seurat object
merged_seurat <- merge(x = ctrl_raw_feature_bc_matrix, 
                       y = stim_raw_feature_bc_matrix, 
                       add.cell.id = c("ctrl", "stim"))
```

Because the same cell IDs are used for different samples, we add a sample-specific prefix to each of our cell IDs using the `add.cell.id` argument. Let's take a look at the metadata:

```r
# Explore merged metadata
View(merged_seurat@meta.data)
```

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/merged_seurat_meta.png" width="500">
</p>

You should see each cell has a `ctrl_` or `stim_` prefix and an `orig.ident` matching the sample.

Now, we need to extract the counts for this merged object:

```r
# Extract counts for merged data
counts <- GetAssayData(object = merged_seurat, slot = "counts")

```

### Creating metadata object with some QC metrics

Now that we have a counts matrix with the genes as row names and cells as columns, we can create our metadata with information about the different metrics to evaluate during quality control assessment.

We will create the metadata dataframe by extracting the `meta.data` slot from the Seurat object: 

```r
# Create metadata containing only the cell IDs
metadata <- merged_seurat@meta.data
```

This should contain information about the sample (`orig.ident`), number of UMIs (`nCount_RNA`), and number of genes detected (`nFeature_RNA`) for each cell. We can add metrics to this object for QC purposes.

First, let's add a column with our cell IDs and change the column names to be more intuitive:

```r
# Add cell IDs to metadata
metadata$cells <- rownames(metadata)

# Rename columns
metadata <- metadata %>%
        dplyr::rename(seq_folder = orig.ident,
                      nUMI = nCount_RNA,
                      nGene = nFeature_RNA)
```

Now, let's get sample names for each of the cells based on the cell prefix:

```r
# Create sample column
metadata$sample <- NA
metadata$sample[which(str_detect(metadata$cells, "^ctrl_"))] <- "ctrl"
metadata$sample[which(str_detect(metadata$cells, "^stim_"))] <- "stim"
```

Now we need to calculate some metrics for plotting:

- **number of genes detected per UMI:** this metric with give us an idea of the complexity of our dataset (more genes detected per UMI, more complex our data)
- **mitochondrial ratio:** this metric will give us a percentage of cell reads originating from the mitochondrial genes

The number of genes per UMI for each cell is quite easy to calculate, and we will log10 transform the result for better comparison between samples.

```r
# Add number of UMIs per gene for each cell to metadata
metadata$log10GenesPerUMI <- log10(metadata$nGene) / log10(metadata$nUMI)
```

The determination of mitochondrial ratios is a bit more complex and requires us to use genome annotations to determine which genes originated from the mitochondrial DNA.

### Using annotation file to generate mitochondrial count metrics

We will be using [AnnotationHub](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/AnnotationHub/inst/doc/AnnotationHub.html), which allows accession to a wide variety of online databases and other resources, to query Ensembl annotations made available through [ensembldb](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/ensembldb/inst/doc/ensembldb.html). Ensembldb is a package that retrieves annotation for the databases directly from Ensembl.

### Downloading database for organism of interest

To access the various annotations available from Ensembl for human, we need to first connect to AnnotationHub, then specify the organism and database we are interested in.
 
```r
# Connect to AnnotationHub
ah <- AnnotationHub()

# Access the Ensembl database for organism
ahDb <- query(ah, 
              pattern = c("Homo sapiens", "EnsDb"), 
              ignore.case = TRUE)

```

Next, we acquire the latest annotation files from this Ensembl database. 

We can first check which annotation versions are available:

```r
# Check versions of databases available
ahDb %>% 
  mcols()
```

Since we want the most recent, we will return the AnnotationHub ID for this database:

```r
# Acquire the latest annotation files
id <- ahDb %>%
  mcols() %>%
  rownames() %>%
  tail(n = 1)
```
  
Finally, we can use the AnnotationHub connection to download the appropriate Ensembl database, which should be version GRCh38.92.

```r
# Download the appropriate Ensembldb database
edb <- ah[[id]]
```

And to extract gene-level information we can use the Ensembldb function `genes()` to return a data frame of annotations.

```r
# Extract gene-level information from database
annotations <- genes(edb, 
                     return.type = "data.frame")                
```

### Exracting IDs for mitochondrial genes

We aren't interested in all of the information present in this `annotations` file, so we are going to extract that which is useful to us.

```r
# Select annotations of interest
annotations <- annotations %>%
  dplyr::select(gene_id, gene_name, gene_biotype, seq_name, description, entrezid)
                         
View(annotations)    
```

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/annotations.png" width="800">
</p>

Now we can retrieve the genes associated with the different biotypes of interest:

```r
# Extract IDs for mitochondrial genes
mt <- annotations %>%
        dplyr::filter(seq_name == "MT") %>%
        dplyr::pull(gene_name)
```

### Adding metrics to metadata

Now that we have information about which genes are mitochondrial, we can quanitify whether we have contamination.

```r
# Number of UMIs assigned to mitochondrial genes
metadata$mtUMI <- Matrix::colSums(counts[which(rownames(counts) %in% mt),], na.rm = T)

# Calculate of mitoRatio per cell
metadata$mitoRatio <- metadata$mtUMI/metadata$nUMI
```

Now you are **all setup with the metrics you need to assess the quality of your data**! Your final metadata table will have rows that correspond to each cell, and columns with information about those cells:

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/metadata_scrnaseq.png" width="900">
</p>


### Saving metrics to single cell experiment 

Before we assess our metrics we are going to save all of the work we have done thus far to a single cell experiment object, which is a standard object for single cell data in R.

```r
# Save data to single cell experiment variable
se <- SingleCellExperiment(assays=list(counts=counts), 
                           colData = metadata)
                           
# Create .RData object to load at any time
saveRDS(se, "data/raw_se.rds")
```

## Assessing the quality metrics

Now that we have generated the various metrics to assess, we can explore them with visualizations. We will create our metrics file from the metadata stored in the single cell experiments.

```r
# Create a data frame containing the metrics for visualizations
metrics <- colData(se) %>%
  as.data.frame
```

We will explore the following metrics through visualizations to decide on which cells are low quality and should be removed from the analysis:

- Cell counts
- UMI counts per cell
- Genes detected per cell
- UMIs vs. genes detected
- Mitochondrial counts ratio
- Novelty


### Cell counts

The cell counts are determined by the number of unique cellular barcodes detected. 

You expect the number of unique cellular barcodes to be around the number of sequenced cells or greater. In single-cell protocols using hydrogels, like inDrops, some hydrogels may have more than one cellular barcode (see details in note below). After we remove the low quality cells by filtering, we will expect the number of cells to be at or a bit below the number of sequenced cells.

> **NOTE:** During the **inDrops** protocol, the cellular barcodes are present in the hydrogels, which are encapsulated in the droplets with a single cell and lysis/reaction mixture. Upon treatment of UV and cell lysis, all components mix together inside the droplet and reverse transcription proceeds, followed by droplet breakup and linear amplification for library preparation. While each hydrogel should have a single cellular barcode associated with it, occasionally a hydrogel can have more than one cellular barcode. We often see all possible combinations of cellular barcodes at a low level, leading to a higher number of cellular barcodes than cells.

```r
# Visualize the number of cell counts per cell
metrics %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=sample, fill=sample)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  ggtitle("NCells")
```


<p align="center">
<img src="../img/cell_counts.png" width="600">
</p>


### UMI counts (transcripts) per cell

The UMI counts per cell should generally be above 500, although usable, it's still low if between 500-1000 counts. If UMIs per cell is 500-1000 counts, then the cells probably should have been sequenced more deeply. 

```r
# Visualize the number UMIs/transcripts per cell
metrics %>% 
        ggplot(aes(color=sample, x=nUMI, fill= sample)) + 
        geom_density(alpha = 0.2) + 
        scale_x_log10() + 
        ylab("log10 cell density") +
        geom_vline(xintercept = 500)
```

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/nUMIs.png" width="600">
</p>
   
### Genes detected per cell

Seeing gene detection in the range of 500-5000 is normal for **inDrop** analysis. Similar expectations for gene detection as for UMI detection, although may be a bit lower than UMIs.

```r
# Visualize the distribution of genes detected per cell via histogram
metrics %>% 
        ggplot(aes(color=sample, x=nGene, fill= sample)) + 
        geom_density(alpha = 0.2) + 
        scale_x_log10() + 
        geom_vline(xintercept = 200)

# Visualize the distribution of genes detected per cell via boxplot
metrics %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x=sample, y=log10(nGene), fill=sample)) + 
        geom_boxplot() + 
        ggtitle("NCells vs NGenes")
```

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/genes_detected.png" width="600">
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/Ncells_vs_ngenes.png" width="600">
</p>

### UMIs vs. genes detected

Poor quality cells are likely to have low genes and UMIs per cell. Therefore, a poor sample is likely to have cells in the lower left of the graph. Good cells should exhibit both higher number of genes per cell and higher numbers of UMIs. We also expect similar lines with similar slopes for all samples.

```r
# Visualize the correlation between genes detected and number of UMIs and determine whether strong presence of cells with low numbers of genes/UMIs
metrics %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x=nUMI, y=nGene, color=mitoRatio)) + 
        geom_point() + 
        stat_smooth(method=lm) +
        scale_x_log10() + 
        scale_y_log10() + 
        geom_vline(xintercept = 500) +
        geom_hline(yintercept = 250) +
        facet_wrap(~sample)
```

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/UMIs_vs_genes.png" width="600">
</p>

### Mitochondrial counts ratio

This metric can identify whether there is a large amount of mitochondrial contamination from dead or dying cells. Poor quality samples for mitochondrial counts would have larger peaks above the 0.1 mitochondrial ratio mark, unless it is expected based on sample type.

```r
# Visualize the distribution of mitochondrial gene expression detected per cell
metrics %>% 
        ggplot(aes(color=sample, x=mitoRatio, fill=sample)) + 
        geom_density(alpha = 0.2) + 
        scale_x_log10() + 
        geom_vline(xintercept = 0.1)
```
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/mitoRatio.png" width="600">
</p>

### Novelty

We can see the samples where we sequenced each cell less have a higher overall novelty, that is because we have not started saturating the sequencing for any given gene for these samples. Outlier cells in these samples might be cells that have a less complex RNA species than other cells. Sometimes we can detect contamination with low complexity cell types like red blood cells via this metric. Generally, we expect the novelty score to be above 0.80.

```r
# Visualize the overall novelty of the gene expression by visualizing the genes detected per UMI
metrics %>%
        ggplot(aes(x=log10GenesPerUMI, color = sample, fill=sample)) +
        geom_density(alpha = 0.2)
```

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/novelty.png" width="600">
</p>

> **NOTE:** **Reads per cell** is another metric that can be useful to explore; however, the workflow used would need to save this information to assess. Generally, with this metric you hope to see all of the samples with peaks in relatively the same location between 10,000 and 100,000 reads per cell. 

## Filtering

Now that we have visualized the various metrics, we can decide on the thresholds to use to remoe the low quality. Often the recommendations mentioned earlier are a rough guideline, but the specific experiment needs to inform the exact thresholds chosen. We will use the following thresholds:

- nUMI > 500
- nGene > 250
- log10GenesPerUMI > 0.8
- mitoRatio < 0.2

```r
# Filter out low quality reads using selected thresholds - these will change with experiment
keep_cells <- metrics %>%
  dplyr::filter(nUMI >= 500 ,

## Re-assess QC metrics

After performing the filtering, it's recommended to look back over the metrics to make sure that your data matches your expectations and is good for downstream analysis.

### Cell counts

After filtering, we should not have more cells than we sequenced. Generally we aim to have about the number we sequenced or a bit less. With 2,700 cells sequenced, we would expect to return around this number of cells. We have about 2,480 returned after filtering, which is pretty good. 

```r
## Cell counts
metrics_clean %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x=sample, fill=sample)) + 
        geom_bar() + 
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1)) +
        ggtitle("NCells")
```

### UMI counts

The filtering using a threshold of 500 has removed the cells with low numbers of UMIs from the analysis.

```r
# UMI counts
metrics_clean %>% 
        ggplot(aes(color=sample, x=nUMI, fill= sample)) + 
        geom_density(alpha = 0.2) + 
        scale_x_log10() + 
        ylab("log10 cell density") +
        geom_vline(xintercept = 500)
```

### Genes detected

```r
# Genes detected
metrics_clean %>% 
        ggplot(aes(color=sample, x=nGene, fill= sample)) + 
        geom_density(alpha = 0.2) + 
        scale_x_log10() + 
        geom_vline(xintercept = 250)
```

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/genes_detected_filtered.png" width="600">
</p>

### UMIs vs genes
```r
# UMIs vs genes
metrics_clean %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x=nUMI, y=nGene, fill = mitoRatio)) + 
        geom_point() + 
        stat_smooth(method=lm) +
        scale_x_log10() + 
        scale_y_log10() + 
        geom_vline(xintercept = 500) +
        facet_wrap(~sample)
```

### Mitochondrial counts ratio
```r
# Mitochondrial counts ratio
metrics_clean %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fill=sample, x=mitoRatio, color=sample)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2) + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.2)
```

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/mitoRatio_filtered.png" width="600">
</p>

### Novelty
```r
# Novelty
metrics_clean %>%
        ggplot(aes(x=log10GenesPerUMI, color = sample, fill=sample)) +
        geom_density(alpha = 0.2)  + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.8)
```

## Saving filtered cells

Based on these QC metrics we would identify any failed samples and move forward with our filtered cells. Often we iterate through the QC metrics using different filtering criteria; it is not necessarily a linear process. When satisfied with the filtering criteria, we would save our filtered cell object for clustering and marker identification.

```r
# Save cleaned single-cell experimnet as .RData to load at any time
saveRDS(se_c, file = "data/se_filtered.rds")
```
