1. **Choose the most appropriate approach.** You do not expect a lot of cell type heterogeneity in your samples and you would like to determine the effects of a treatment on gene expression.
    - i. **Bulk RNA-seq**
    - i. scRNA-seq
    
1. **Choose the most appropriate approach.** You would like to characterize the cell types present in a tissue.
    - i. Bulk RNA-seq
    - i. **scRNA-seq**
    
1. **Choose the most appropriate approach.** You would like to determine the genes turned on during differentiation of a particular cell type.
    - i. Bulk RNA-seq
    - i. **scRNA-seq**
    
1. **Choose the most appropriate approach.** You would like to identify a strong biomarker for a disease in which we expect a lot of heterogeneity across cell types.
    - i. Bulk RNA-seq
    - i. **scRNA-seq**
    
1. **Choose the most appropriate approach.** You FACS sort your samples for a cell type of interest and would like to determine the differential expression of gene isoforms.
    - i. **Bulk RNA-seq**
    - i. scRNA-seq
    
1. **Choose the most appropriate approach.** You would like to determine differentially expressed genes between 2 conditions in heterogenous tissue; but, your budget can only handle either 1 scRNA-seq sample/condition or multiple bulk RNA-seq samples/condition.

    - i. scRNA-seq
